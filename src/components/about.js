                children and families. When I moved to Australia in 2010, I
                started to learn Swedish massage and completed my diploma of
                Remedial Massage in 2014. Then, I started to think how to
                combine these professional skills together. Therefore I choose
                to be a specialist of Pregnancy Massage. However, that doesnâ€™t
                mean I only work with pregnancy ladies. I am more than happy to
                provide my support to every members in the family, Fathers,
                Mothers, Grandparents, Sons, Daughters, etc. with 8 years in the
