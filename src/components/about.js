                I completed my Bachelor of Education and worked as a teacher in
                child cares and kindergarten in Taiwan. I LOVE to work with
                children and families. When I moved to Australia in 2010, I
                started to learn Swedish massage and completed my Diploma of
                Remedial Massage in 2014. Then, I started to think about how to
                combine these professional skills together. Therefore I choose
                to be a specialist in Pregnancy Massage. However, that doesnâ€™t
                mean I only work with pregnant ladies.
              </p>

                am extending my service to support the ladies who are struggling
                in infertility, irregular menstrual cycle, imbalance hormones
                during menopause, heavy period pain ...etc. Also I am more than
                happy to provide my support to every member in the family,
                Fathers, Mothers, Grandparents, Sons, Daughters, etc. with 9
                years in the field of Remedial Massage, I have wealth of
                experience that will ensure that you obtain the best result of
                your care, I am dedicated to working with you and your family to
