          <p>
            <strong>Fertility Massage Therapy</strong> is a deep, yet gentle,
            non invasive abdominal and sacral therapy that focus on improving
            circulation to the abdominal organs with an aim to improve blood,
            nerve and lymph flow. The massage also focus on releasing physical
            and emotional tension, helping to loosen debris (that has been
            accumulating in your gut for years) encouraging a natural movement
            and clearing both physical and emotional congestion, leaving you and
            your abdomen feeling lighter and freer.â €
